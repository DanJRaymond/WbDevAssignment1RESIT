5.	mgp.html – This page will demonstrate your knowledge of Models of Good Practice (MGP) in User Interface (UI) Design. Your submission must demonstrate ‘current’ UI (user interface) design practices. Do not work out of your head. You must find sites that are current as models of design. There is a tendency to work from what you think is a good website, this never works, you will need to educate yourself and look at current conventions in design. There are many resources available on NILE. Make sure to design from Mobile up to desktop as more than 85% of users use mobiles first over desktop computers. Use Google Material Design as an approach and you can’t go too far wrong. Students often find this the most challenging aspect of the assignment. On this page you must:
  1.	Provide links and screenshots of pages that were influential in your interface design decisions.

  2.	Write at least 200 words minimum explaining your choices and the ways you decided on the best design and the process to improve it over time. Sketches may be included.

      Design:
When designing my website, I decided to take influence from a plethora of websites, my main idea was to look at websites that had won awards for their design. I also decided to look at websites that had a lot of traffic, such as news websites, I figured this would be a good idea because websites with a lot of traffic must have a good and intuitive design layout otherwise users would not go back to them.

<p class="mgp">
  I was also interested in the ways the user could interact with the website, small things like the hover feature in the navigation bar, these things may seem small, but I think they can or could have a bigger impact on the user’s overall experience when using a website.
</p>

<p class="mgp">
  For the third page displaying my CV, I have chosen to display a different style of layout with the flexbox layout.
</p>
<p class="mgp">
  To further improve the website both in design and interactivity I think I would have to look at more websites that have won awards in recent times, I would also have to investigate the psychology of it, such as; the “Cone Principle”.
